myMPD
=====

myMPD is a lightweight MPD web client that runs without a dedicated webserver or interpreter. 
It's tuned for minimal resource usage and requires only very few dependencies.

myMPD is a fork of ympd (https://github.com/notandy/ympd).
This fork provides a reworked ui based on Bootstrap 4, a modernized backend and many new features while having the same small footprint as ympd.
